## **CPSC 4800: Computing for Data Analytics**

In this lab you will get a practice working with github including creating and forking a repo on github.

### Exercise 1 - Creating a repo on github, learning more about markdown

- Creat a github account here [(https://github.com/)](https://github.com/)
- Create a new public repository called "hello-world" on github, add a description of your repository  
"My first repository on GitHub.". Initialize this repository with a README.
- In your repository's list of files, click README.md.
- Above the file's content, click edit.
- On the Edit file tab, create the sample README file that is similar to this file, the aim is to practice  
working with the markdown document so please ensure that your file is looking similar to the pdf file  
**Note: you can use this [online markdown editor website](https://dillinger.io/) to practice renderign markdown  
files.**
- Above the new content, click Preview changes to ensure that what your have written is similar to the  
above text
- At the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you  
made to the file
- Click Propose file change
- Clone the repo on your desired location on your laptop, to clone the repositort on your local machine,  
follow the below steps:

1- In your repository that you've made above, under code, you will see the URL of the repository. Copy the  
URL, here is an example:

2- Open terminal on Mac or Git bash on windows:

Type **`pwd`** to print the working directory. If your type **`ls`**, you can see the list of the files in your directory.

To change the working directory, you cn type **`cd`**. For instance, you can type **`cd folder/to/clone-into/`**  
to change the path to the directory that you want to clone the file. I copies the repo to my C: drive per  
below example

**Good Job. You have created a new repository including a readme file and you have learned  
how to write a markdown document and clone a repo.**
